# Practical exercise

Create an Android application which has the following:


FEATURES
* Show a list of transactions corresponding to an account (Android.Transactions.png)
* Example data has been included (exercise.json)
* On this screen, ensure that the account information on top scrolls off the screen (Android.Transactions.Scrolling.png)
* Note that the transactions (both cleared and pending) should be shown in a combined list, by descending date order


REQUIREMENTS
* Use Kotlin
* Write tests


BONUS MARKS
* Group transactions by date
* Some transactions will be ATM withdrawals. These rows should be indicated by the location icon.
* Tapping on an ATM withdrawal row will show the location of the ATM on a map
* Dynamically pull down data from https://www.dropbox.com/s/tewg9b71x0wrou9/data.json?dl=1
* Implement an algorithm that will give the user a projected spend over the next two weeks
